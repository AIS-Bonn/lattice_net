    // slice_no_deform - doesn't use delta weights for the slicing, by setting them to zero
    // pointnet_no_elevate - doesn't elevate the distributed points into a higher dimensional space before doing the max but still substracts the local mean
    // pointnet_no_local_mean - doesn't perform the local mean substraction of the xyz positions and just uses them as is
    // pointnet_no_elevate_no_local_mean - doesnt elevate and doesnt do local mean
    // splat - just does a mean of all the features that fall into the lattice vertex without any elevatation or mean substraction
